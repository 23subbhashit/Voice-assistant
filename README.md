# Voice-assistant
Voice assistants come in somewhat small packages and can perform a variety of actions after hearing a wake word or command. They can turn on lights, answer questions, play music, open apps in your system, etc.

This is a small demonstration of a simple voice assistant which can perform a number of small tasks.
